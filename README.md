# WWDC21-Galton-Board
a simulation of the galton board made for the WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge (accepted)
<br>
For the WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge, I decided to recreate a simulation of the Galton Board in Swift, something I had [previously done as a website](https://garv-shah.github.io/pascal/). Since I had used it as an educational tool for my class in Grade 7, I thought it would be perfect for this project. The zip file seen in the repo is a Swift Playgrounds project, and was the one I submitted. <br>And thankfully I was accepted (yay)!
