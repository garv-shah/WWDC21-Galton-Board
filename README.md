# WWDC21-Galton-Board
a simulation of the galton board made for the WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge (accepted)
<br>
For the WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge, I created a simulation of the Galton Board in Swift. The Galton Board can be used as an educational tool to teach students about the concepts of Pascal's Triangle. I have created a similar simulation [here](https://garv-shah.github.io/pascal/).<br>The zip file seen in the repo is a Swift Playgrounds project, and was the one I submitted.
